# 7-Card-Stud-Poker

### About

This project was built for CSC-120 / Programming on Purpose. This course taught the fundamentals of what it means to write "good" software or "clean" software. The game was built for Project 1 in the course.

#### Project description

_You will write a program that computes how likely certain kinds of hands are in a simplified version of the game of poker._

### Python

Contained in the Python code is modular pythonic code. However, this is my first project in this class, which is a class that I grew substantially in. I recommend to check out Project 4 - 7 Stud Poker. This project is a much better signifier of how much I grew in this class. *(Proj. 4 Written in Java)*
